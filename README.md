# Voice Assistant with Weather Updates

This project implements a voice assistant that can process text and audio inputs to provide responses from a generative AI model. Additionally, it can fetch weather updates based on user input. The project uses the following technologies:

- **Google Generative AI** for generating responses.
- **Speech Recognition** for converting speech to text.
- **pyttsx3** for text-to-speech functionality.
- **WeatherAPI** for fetching weather information.

## Features

- **Text Input**: Allows users to enter text and receive a generated response.
- **Audio Input**: Converts spoken words into text and processes it to generate responses.
- **Weather Updates**: Provides current weather information based on user-specified city.

    ```

3. **Install the required packages:**

    Create a virtual environment (optional but recommended):

    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

    Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    pip install pyttsx3 SpeechRecognition google-generativeai requests
    ```

## Configuration
